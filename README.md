<h1>Pathfinding Algorithms in a maze</h1>

The python files take in the location of the input file (maze) as a command line argument (-i), performs a search, and outputs the final path, path cost, and expanded nodes.
The input file should contain walls represented by "%", the starting agent represented by "P", and goal(s) represented by ".".
