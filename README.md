<h1>Pathfinding Algorithms in a maze</h1>

The python files take in the location of the input file (maze) as a command line argument (-i), performs a search, and outputs the final path(#), path cost, and expanded nodes.
The input file should contain walls represented by "%", the starting agent represented by "P", and goal(s) represented by ".".

Command for running:
`python3 <script-name> -i <path-to-input-file>`
<p>If you provide no input file name, the script with run on all test cases by default.<p>
<p>The folder Maze_Outputs contains the outputs of each pathfinding algorithm for each testcase (lab_a_files).<p>

<h2>Included Pathfinding Algorithms</h2>
<p>Depth-first Search (single_dfs.py)</p>
<p>Breadth-first Search (single_bfs.py)</p>
<p>Greedy Best-first Search (single_gbfs.py)</p>
<p>A* Search(single_astar.py)</p>
